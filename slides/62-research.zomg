### Research (Network Hardware, Bad Checksum)
/!
// Bad Checksum with eBPF is very easy to trigger.
//
// Most cloud providers (Tested: AWS) are liable to drop
// malformed packets before they reach their destination.
//
// This is why boopkit supports multiple boop methods.
//
// A single SYN packet is VERY difficult because of network traversal.
